<body> <b>Proposal:</b>
<ul><li>Our group will analyze the rental price index from Zillow for the years 2010 through 2015.</li>

	<li>Specifically, we are looking at the northeastern, pacfic-northwest, west, south, and midwest.</li>
	<li>We will compare the rental price trends of these major regions to the overall rates of homelessness to find any intrinsic correlation. </li></ul>
